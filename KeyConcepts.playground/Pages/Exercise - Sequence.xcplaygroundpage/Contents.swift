 ## Exercise
 
 Each image is exactly 400 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall.
 
 Your goal is to precisely reproduce this image (the underlying image, not the planning grid):
 
 ![tjamc-no-grid.png](tjamc-no-grid.png "The Jesus and Mary Chain")
 ![tjamc-with-grid.png](tjamc-with-grid.png "The Jesus and Mary Chain")
 
 By precisely reproducing this image, you will demonstrate your understanding of:
 
 * sequence (order of statements in a program)
 
 You can use the **Digital Color Meter** app (already installed on your Mac) to find specific colours as RGB (red-green-blue) codes.
 
 You [can use this site](http://www.workwithcolor.com/color-converter-01.htm) to convert colours to HSB to use with the Canvas class.
 
 Or, if you wish, you may use the color constants created below.
